## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Splide (for slider) [https://splidejs.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to manage some interesting components, such as a **slider** (different between the mobile and tablet/desktop version) and a **lightbox within a dialog**.

for the photo slider I used a dedicated JS library, which was a little easier to implement to customize it according to the specific design required, but overall everything worked out quite well.

### Continued development

I will always continue on this path, on the one hand different and increasingly complicated challenges regarding design, on the other hand learning to manage different **JS** scenarios in order to be able to create the different situations proposed more manually ;)
